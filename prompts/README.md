## System Prompts

### alpaca-2.txt (default)


This file is the default system prompt used in the SFT phase, which is simple. Thus, the length of the response may be shorter than 1st-gen Pro series models.

### alpaca-2-long.txt


This file is an improved system prompt sample to extend the response length. The users can modify this prompt if necessary. However, we suggest keep the original content in `alpaca-2.txt` and add your customized prompt based on this.
